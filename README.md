# InteractionFragHub: Fragment Libraries from Protein-Ligand Interactions: Uncovering New Opportunities for Targeted Drug Design

<br>This repository contains the code for setting up and implementing the InterFragHub local platform, a web-based tool for visualizing and interacting with fragment-based molecular design.The platform provides an interactive interface to facilitate the assembly, optimization, and analysis of molecular fragments.
Key features of the InterFragHub platform include:
    (1)Break Moleucles;
    (2)Split PDB Complex;
    (3)Generate Interaction Fragments;
    (4)Search Fragments;
    (5)Optimize molecules based on Fragments.
